        Autonomous: "Reliably hangs a specimen in the high chamber, drops a sample in the high basket, and parks in the observation zone.",
        TeleOp: "Focuses on picking up samples and cycling through about eight samples.",
        EndGame: "Drops two more samples in the high basket and completes a Level 2 ascent."
    },
    CommunityOutreach: {
        RobotDemos: "Hosted demos at Independence High Schoolâ€™s STEM Day Expo, inspiring over 15 students to get involved in FIRST.",
        CADCourse: "Held a three-day CAD course at the local library, raising over $1,000 while teaching middle school students how to 3D print real-world solutions.",
        Mentorship: "Mentored a rookie team, helping them build their first functional robot and teaching them how to code."
